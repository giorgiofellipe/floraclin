# Date & timezone conventions

**Context.** Brazil-only product. Production nominally runs in `America/Sao_Paulo`; containers (Vercel, CI, preview deploys) run UTC. A `YYYY-MM-DD` string is a **BR calendar day**, not an instant. `new Date("2026-04-16")` parses as UTC midnight, which silently becomes the previous day in BR (−3h). Every date bug we've shipped has been a variant of this.

## The rule

**Never do this:**

- `new Date(yyyyMmDd)` — bare. Parses as UTC.
- `someDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]` — converts to UTC first, can flip the day.
- `format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')` in server code — uses the process TZ, wrong on UTC hosts.
- `moment(...)` — not installed, don't add it.
- `cron.schedule("0 8 * * *", fn)` without an explicit `{ timezone: 'America/Sao_Paulo' }` option.

**Always use `@/lib/dates`:**

| Context | Helper | Returns |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Date-range filter lower bound (server) | `startOfBrDay(ymd)` | `Date` at BR 00:00 → UTC instant |
| Date-range filter upper bound (server) | `endOfBrDay(ymd)` | `Date` at BR 23:59:59.999 → UTC instant |
| User-entered BR calendar day, anchored to a safe time | `parseBrDate(ymd, '12:00:00')` | `Date` at BR noon → UTC instant |
| Client/browser: user-picked date, local-anchored | `parseLocalDate(ymd, '12:00:00')` | `Date` at host-local clock |
| "Today" as a string, regardless of host TZ | `brToday()` | `'YYYY-MM-DD'` in BR |
| Instant → BR calendar day | `toBrYmd(date)` | `'YYYY-MM-DD'` |
| Date → `YYYY-MM-DD` using local getters (no UTC round-trip) | `toLocalYmd(date)` | `'YYYY-MM-DD'` |

All helpers live in `web/src/lib/dates.ts` and wrap `date-fns` / `date-fns-tz`. Don't reach for the underlying libraries directly in feature code unless you have a specific reason — the helpers exist so the rule is trivially reachable.

## DB column conventions

- `timestamp({ withTimezone: true })` (`timestamptz`) — real-world instants: `createdAt`, `paidAt`, `performedAt`, `movementDate`. Compare with `gte`/`lte` against helper-built `Date` objects.
- `date` (DATE) — BR calendar days: `installments.dueDate`, `expenseInstallments.dueDate`, `appointments.date`, `procedureRecords.followUpDate`. Stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; never call `new Date()` on them directly — route through `parseBrDate` or `startOfBrDay` first.

## Gotchas

1. **Never `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` bare.** Append `T00:00:00` / `T12:00:00` (client, local) or use `startOfBrDay` / `parseBrDate` (server, BR-safe).
2. **Never `.toISOString().split('T')[0]`** — converts to UTC first. Use `toLocalYmd(date)` or `toBrYmd(date)`.
3. **Cron/background jobs**: pass `{ timezone: 'America/Sao_Paulo' }` explicitly. `"0 8 * * *"` on a UTC container fires at 05:00 BRT — three hours off — unless you tell it otherwise. (No cron jobs exist today. This rule is a guardrail for when they're added.)
4. **Unit tests that compare against "today"** should construct dates via `parseBrDate` or mock `Date.now()` — `new Date()` inside a test breaks on UTC CI around midnight BRT.
5. **Filter ranges**: lower bound uses `startOfBrDay`, upper bound uses `endOfBrDay`. Do not mix bare `new Date(dateFrom)` with `setHours(23,59,59,999)` — the `setHours` call operates on whatever TZ the runtime is in, which isn't BR on Vercel.

## Do / Don't examples

**Filtering financial entries (Extrato):**

```ts
// ❌ DON'T — UTC midnight boundaries; misses or includes a BR day depending on host
sql`${financialEntries.createdAt} >= ${dateFrom}::timestamp`

// ✅ DO — BR-local boundaries, host-independent
import { startOfBrDay, endOfBrDay } from '@/lib/dates'
gte(financialEntries.createdAt, startOfBrDay(dateFrom))
lte(financialEntries.createdAt, endOfBrDay(dateTo))
```

**Generating an installment due date:**

```ts
// ❌ DON'T — on UTC host, this produces the next BR day at 21:00 BRT and later
addDays(today, 30).toISOString().split('T')[0]

// ✅ DO — uses local getters, no UTC round-trip
import { toLocalYmd } from '@/lib/dates'
toLocalYmd(addDays(today, 30))
```

**Calculating days overdue on a `YYYY-MM-DD` due date:**

```ts
// ❌ DON'T — UTC midnight; the day flips by one on UTC hosts
const due = new Date(dueDate)

// ✅ DO — BR-local midnight, safe everywhere
import { startOfBrDay } from '@/lib/dates'
const due = startOfBrDay(dueDate)
```

## When in doubt

Ask: "Is this a calendar day or an instant?"

- **Calendar day** (due date, follow-up date, appointment date, report window) → BR-anchored helper.
- **Instant** (createdAt, paidAt, performedAt, signed_at) → raw `Date`, compared with helper-built boundaries when ranging.

# Never push without running the checks

`pnpm install` at the repo root installs a `pre-push` git hook (via `simple-git-hooks`) that runs **lint + typecheck + tests** before any push. The same three checks run in GitHub Actions on every PR and every push to `main`.

## Rule

**Never use `git push --no-verify` (or `-n`).** The hook exists to catch broken code before CI does.

If the hook fails:
- **Fix the actual failure.** Don't skip it, don't silence warnings, don't `--no-verify`.
- If a check is slow enough that you routinely want to bypass it, that's a signal to fix the check — raise it, don't work around it.

## Commands

Run the same checks manually at any time:

```bash
pnpm ci:checks                 # lint + typecheck + test:run (same as CI / hook)
pnpm lint                      # lint only
pnpm typecheck                 # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test                      # vitest (watch mode)
pnpm --filter @floraclin/web test:run   # vitest single run
```

## If the hook doesn't fire

It's registered by `pnpm install`'s `prepare` script. On a fresh clone or after pulling a branch that changed `.git/hooks/`, run:

```bash
pnpm install           # re-runs prepare → re-registers the hook
# or
pnpm exec simple-git-hooks   # registers without reinstalling
```

Before opening a PR, **always** run `pnpm ci:checks` locally to confirm green. The hook catches most of it, but it's wise to verify on the final commit.

<!-- BEGIN:whatsapp-template-rules -->
# WhatsApp template rules (Meta Cloud API)

Meta's template API has strict, poorly-documented validation. Follow these rules when creating or editing templates.

## Body text

**Never end body text with a variable.** Even `{{4}}.` (variable + punctuation only) is rejected with "Variables can't be at the start or end of the template." Always add meaningful text after the last variable.

```
❌ '...no dia {{3}}, às {{4}}.'
✅ '...no dia {{3}}, às {{4}}. Por favor, confirme abaixo.'
```

The same rule applies to the start — don't begin body text with `{{1}}`.

## Editing approved templates

**Meta does not allow substantive edits on approved templates.** Changes to body text, buttons, or headers require creating a new template and going through approval again. Don't call `editTemplate` to change content — instead delete-and-recreate with a new name (see below).

## Deleting and recreating

**Meta enforces a ~30-day cooldown on deleted template names.** After deleting a template, you cannot create a new one with the same name. Always use a different name when recreating (e.g. `confirm_appointment` instead of `appointment_confirmation`).

## Name changes require updating references

When a template name changes, update:
1. The `whatsapp_templates` DB record (`name` column) — used by `sendTemplateMessage`
2. The blueprint `name` field in `whatsapp-blueprints.ts` — used by the provision API
3. The migration script itself — so it's idempotent on re-run

The `purposeKey` stays the same — automations and the cron job resolve templates by `purposeKey`, not by name.
